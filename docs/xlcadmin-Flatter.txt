PAGES FOR INTERFACING
--------------------------
1. Authentication Flow [completed here already in our API setup --DO NOT ALTER]
   - /login -> Dashboard redirect
   - Token refresh handling
   - Session management
   - Role verification

[this is where we will start]
2. Dashboard Interface (this is the main landing and where will have a comprehensive overview of each module with graphs, etc.)
   - /dashboard
     - Wallet Balances (going forward xlc and "bank" are used interchangeably. this is the bank's balances, we need to be able to switch between multiple wallets that the bank manages its funds through, all balances should be fetched from the blockchain and written to the database on page load when our dashboard is accessed. This data needs to have a helper function that prevents fetching data for 1 minute even on page refreshes. we can use timestamps on the balance updates to do this )
     - Balance tracking 
     - xlC Holder count
     - Transaction monitoring (fetching last 10 transactions from the blockchain on page load and storing them in databse for fetching by client app, needs to have a comprehensive timestamp system that prevents fetches if data is less than 1 minute old. We will have a function that deletes the )

3. Token Operations (this is where we send xlc to and from, among other things)
   - /token-operations
     - Transfer management
     - Balance checks (using database info we stored when the dashboard initialized)
     - Contract interactions 9with our xlc contract)
     - Transaction history (fetching from database info we stored already in Dashboard on page load update process) 

4. User Management (this list comes from the database path users/userid. each user will have personal info to display as shown below)
   - /users
     - User listing (fetching from database)
     - Profile management (fetching and displaying user info from realtime database path that is structured like this:
     users
Mj03qpcX9XPQDn9AlUzJPX3J7562

) in this example, 5 users are shown with the last one having their data structure shown to implicate the data we have to fetch and display in this module. 

     - Activity tracking (will really only serve to show us flagged transactions and the user they are related to directly, as discussed below)

5. API Management (this page is for displaying data related to external API calls from third party apps such as our xlC app or other apps that integrate xlC wallets into their projects. It is not in any way for managing the xlC application end users as hte other sections of this interface are ,but rather managing the API backend and it's Users which will be saved and fetched from their own node/path in the database that we will create and fully flesh out at apiUsers/v1flatter/userid/). All of these tabbed interfaces within the API management interface will manage the various aspects and expansions to our functionality as we iterate.
   - /api-management
     - Dashboard metrics
     - User operations
     - Transaction monitoring
     - Staking management
     - Liquidity tracking
     - Settings configuration

6. Distribution Management (this interface is for directly managing the Staking Pools, Offers, and Rewards associated with Staking Pools and Offers that we feature in the xlc client application. The forms and details of these forms are covered extensively in the file at Distribution.txt and we will follow this exactly as we already have data in the database we want to be backwards compatible with and our user end works with this setup already. This module will require a comprehensive rewards management system that tracks data and takes various actions as a result. We first need to focus on the forms, interface, and pushing data to the database)
   - /distribution
     - Offer management 
     - Rewards overview
     - Staking dashboard
     - Pool management

7. Contract Deployment (this module is for creating and deploying new BEP 20 contracts, tokens, NFTs, etc. This is a completely seperate module that allows us to mint new tokens and NFTs for users and third party apps that want to integrate the xlc API functionality into their application. This entire module should be comprehensive, and allow us to store templates for contracts in the realtime database, fetching them for ease of completion and quick deployment as well as all parameters and functions associate with implementing the needs of each coin type like governance, utility, etc. We want everything to be here. We want to take over the minting of BEP-20 tokens and NFTs from DxSale. Lets delete our competition)
   - /deploy
     - Contract dashboard
     - Security controls
     - Parameter configuration
     - Integration verification

8. Transaction Monitoring (here we will have a comprehensive flagging system that flags certain transactions that are stored in our intial transaction fetch on dashboard loading. these tranasctions will be written elsewhere to a flaggedtransactions folder in the database that will allow us to review it at a later time without it being subject to the deletion of the most recent transactions from the database)
   - /transactions
     - List view
     - Filtering
     - Status tracking
     - Details view
